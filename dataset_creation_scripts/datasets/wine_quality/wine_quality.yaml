curation_comments: |
  - We combine the original datasets for red and white wine into a single dataset with an additional column indicating the type of wine (red or white).
  - We treat the task as a regression problem, following the original work and because the target is the median wine quality (of at least 3 evaluations by experts).
  - Anomaly: the data has a high number of duplicates (18%).
