curation_comments: |
  - We dropped the ID column.
  - We renamed the target feature and its values to be more meaningful.
  - Anomaly: the target and task seems somewhat disconnected from the features. Moreover, some source information on the data is missing and there might be some translation issues.
  - Anomaly: there might be some data issues related to "Warehouse_block" and the value "F" consisting of two block "E" and "F".
