curation_comments: |
  - We drop duplicated patients based on the "patient_nbr" feature to avoid target leakage.
  - We reversed the original ordinal encoding for three ID-based features. 
  - We created the target from the "readmitted" column following the original task description.
  - We dropped "encounter_id" and "patient_nbr", which are both unique identifiers for each row.
  - We keep original "?", NULL-codes, and NaN values because they exist in different ways across the columns.
  - Anomaly: There is a distribution shift based on the original order. The reason for this might be that the encounters are ordered in some way such that later parts of the data contain different sub-groups than earlier parts. This is also indicate by the fact that the "payer_code" feature is responsible for the shift. This distribution shift vanishes after randomly shuffling the data (as done by default for this and all other datasets used in TabArena).
