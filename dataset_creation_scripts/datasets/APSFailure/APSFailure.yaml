curation_comments: |
  - We combined the original training and testing data into a single dataset.
  - We renamed the target feature to "AirPressureSystemFailure".
  - We converted "na" strings to real NaN/missing values, making the data numeric.
  - Anomaly: we cannot determine the data types of the features.
  - Anomaly: some features are bins of histograms (see original data description).
  - Anomaly: the original task used a cost matrix for evaluation.
