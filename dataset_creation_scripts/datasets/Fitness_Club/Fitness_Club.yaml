curation_comments: |
  - We dropped the ID column.
  - We renamed the values of the target variable to be more meaningful.
  - We treat "-0" values as "0" values for the target, following the description.
  - We removed trailing words (like "days") from "days_before".
  - We aligned the naming of "day_of_week" to be consistent per day.
