curation_comments: |
  - We rename the features to be shorter and have no special characters.
  - We drop the constant column "Net_Income_Flag".
  - Anomaly: the paper introducing the dataset has more features, but these do not seem to be in the dataset. 
  - Anomaly: the data is temporal but all features are time-invariant. This might still have a latent, non-verifiable temporal component, which we ignore for our predictive IID task.
