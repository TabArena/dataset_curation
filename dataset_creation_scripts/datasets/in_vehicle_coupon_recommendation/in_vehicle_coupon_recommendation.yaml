curation_comments: |
  - We renamed the target feature and its value to be more descriptive.
  - We removed text data from the "time" feature to make it numeric.
  - We drop constant columns.
  - We fixed a typo in the feature names. 
  - Anomaly: the data has many binned numeric features that are treated as categorical features with text describing the bins.
  - Anomaly: the numeric features in the dataset are low-cardinality (<25)
