# Notes from us on how the dataset was curated.
#   - Description of any preprocessing steps we applied.
#   - Any oddities, anomalies, or manual fixes you encountered.
# For formatting, please add the bullet points to the list (start by replacing
#   the N/NA bullet point). This will be printed as a markdown enumeration on OpenML.
curation_comments: |
  - We tabularized the fixed-size DNA sequences from the original dataset based on the nucleotide position.
  - We removed the instance ID.
  - Anomaly: As always, we randomly shuffle the data before uploading. If one would not randomly shuffle the data, there would be a shift based on the original order of data samples.
