curation_comments: |
  - We use the small (230 features) training data from the original data. 
  - We use appetency as label.
  - We dropped empty columns: "Var8", "Var15", "Var20", "Var31", "Var32", "Var39", "Var42", "Var48", "Var52", "Var55", "Var79", "Var141", "Var167", "Var169", "Var175", "Var185", "Var209", "Var230".
  - Anomaly: this dataset has many missing values.
  - Anomaly: the feature names and categorical values have no semantic meaning.
