curation_comments: |
  - We dropped entries with a duplicated ID, keeping only the first one.
  - We dropped the ID column.
  - Anomaly: The ID of the delivery person is given as a feature. In some contexts, this feature might not be allowed to use. Moreover, using this information might require considering a temporal split where a cold-start problem is covered.
