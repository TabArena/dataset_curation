curation_comments: |
  - There are 12 possible targets and four possible time moments to predict the targets for this dataset. We use the categorical target as it summarizes the other possible targets. Furthermore, we use the last possible time point for prediction to utilize all available data. 
  - We treat "?" as missing values.
  - We dropped the "id" column.
  - We reversed the ordinal encoding of the target feature.
