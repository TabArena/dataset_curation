curation_comments: |
  - We kept the latitude and longitude features as they are.
  - We log scaled the target variable (with base e) as intended by the original task.
  - Anomaly: As always, we randomly shuffle the data before uploading. If one does not randomly shuffle the data, there would be a distribution shift from the longitude and latitude based on the original order of data samples.
